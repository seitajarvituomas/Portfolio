The game is pretty player-friendly to use. You first need to start the game to move the pawns.
Rules can be seen with the buttons "rules", but i will put them here too

-Rules-
move the red pawns where the green ones are originally and the other way around without
going over other pawns. The game will tell if the move is not legal/will no let pawns go on top
of each other. The game should be completed in 31 or 30 moves, but it will let you ponder as much
as you want, but it will say "you lost" if you go over 31 moves to move the pawns.

Example play shows how to win the game in 33 moves. During this the only thing you can do is watch.
When example play ends/manual play ends you need to press "reset". This is on purpose so that the
player can press start in peace so you can hit those record times (:D).
